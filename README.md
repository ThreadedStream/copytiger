# copytiger

Hi, this is a copytiger! Wondering what that might ever mean? No worries, nothing special -- the name already 
tells you about it. Still grappling to comprehend that? Huh, here's a thing. 
Well, my initial aim was to learn the OCaml programming language, but learn it in the unusual way. 
I'm an advocate of "learn-by-copying" philosophy, so I make it my own learning strategy. As a target I picked 
the Tiger compiler. At the end of this journey I will try to compose my own version of it. Let's see what's going to 
come out of that.
